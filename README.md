When Love Meets Maths: Celebrating Valentine’s Day and National Maths Day

February 14th, being both Valentine’s Day and National Maths Day in Ghana, inspired me to do something that combines both! Using HTML Canvas, I drew and animated the most sent emoji on Valentine’s Day (❤️)—correct me if I’m wrong. It turns out that even in matters of the heart, a little bit of maths is needed! 😂😅

The heartbeat animation was created using a sine function, and the heart shape was drawn with a mathematical equation. I could have used the bezierCurveTo method in the HTML Canvas, but I decided to get a little nerdy 🧐.
